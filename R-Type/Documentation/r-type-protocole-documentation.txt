	to lose life and the shots which it sends in order to kill the enemies
	on the ground. the games must be adaptable to multiplayer unfortunately
	the multithraed server is not finished.

	The games run via the SFMl graphics library contained in the clients,
	the solo player games are therefore fully operational.
